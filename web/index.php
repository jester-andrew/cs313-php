    Hey everyone my name is <strong>Andrew Jester</strong> I am from a small town in western Colorado called Montrose.
    I have been married for almost 4 years now. My wife and I have a two year old son and a daughter coming in August. 
    I absolutly love my major of Software enginnering. I work as a TA/Lab Assistant for the cit department over their 
    web development classes. I work at a company called Avercast in Rigby, ID. We are in the process of building a web 
    application to replace their legacy system. We are working with Angular for the client side and Java for the server 
    side of the application. I enjoy being outside hiking and enjpoying the great outdoors the image below is of me and my 
    son on a hiking though our hikes arent this dangerous most of the time. I look forward to working with you all and learning from you!
